# Python_Analyses
Welcome to the Python section of my data analysis portfolio! In this repo you will find projects that showcase the statistical analysis and reporting skills that I have picked up since starting my Python journey in late 2023. These are part of my personal projects collection, which are designated to show my technical abilities over anything. I have a repository that houses personal SQL projects [which can be viewed here.](SQL_Projects)
